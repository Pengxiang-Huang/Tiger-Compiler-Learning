CSci 5161 --- Test cases for the Tiger compiler

There are a few different kinds of tests that are useful depending on
which phase of compiler writing you are currently at. In the
beginning, during syntactic (lexer and parser) and semantic analysis
(type checking, escape calculation etc) the syntax-and-sem-analysis
tests are probably most useful; use the couple of examples in
comments_and_strings to check the treatment of bad comments and
strings during lexical analysis, as explained with hw2. Later, when 
generating intermediate code, the test cases in translation may be
relevant. Eventually, when testing the MIPS code that is generated,
the tests in full-compiler-tests that actually contain meaningful
programs that should produce recognizable results would be useful.
The test cases in select-testcases are ones I have found useful in the
past in checking out particular aspects of students' compilers. They
are all programs that should compile and should produce particular
behaviors when run, they are just not as meaningful as the programs in
full-compiler-tests. I will have more to say about these examples as
the semester progresses and we consider specific "tricky" aspects of
compiling Tiger programs.
